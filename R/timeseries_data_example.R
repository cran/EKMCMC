#' Product concentration of 101 observed time with different initial conditions
#'
#' An artificial data set containing the product concentration
#' observed with the high and low enzyme concentrations.
#' The 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th columns are observed times, and
#' the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th columns are product concentrations.
#' The 2nd and 4th columns are observed with the initial enzyme concentrations of 4.4, and  
#' the 6th and 8th columns are observed with the initial enzyme concentrations of 440.
#' The initial substrate concentrations are 4.4 for all data.
#' 
#' @format A data frame with 101 rows and 8 variables:
